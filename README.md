<h1> data about canser disease </h1>

<h3> first : </h3>
<p> import classes that we need and read file </p>
<h3> second : </h3> 
<p>search about information of data to understand it and treat with </p>
<h3> third :</h3>  <p>cleaning data to prepare it </br>
        1- searching about duplicates find "8" that are dropped </br>
        2- searching about null values and not found </br>
        3- searching about missing values and they were "16" values "?" in one column "Bare Nuclei" </br>
           ** convert it into nan values </br>
           ** calculate column median and replace it </br>
        4- searching about datatypes and "Bare Nuclei"  column was "object" type so we convert it into numeric
           that was "float"😢 then converting to "int46" </br>
           all datatypes were "int64"</br>
        5- dropping useless column "id"</p>
       <h4>      now data is ready  👏👏 </h4>
<h3> fourth :</h3> <p> visualizing data in univaratie and multivaratie then make corr about relationship between each colum and others</p>
<h3> fifth :</h3> <p> modeling data to make predication using knn model in:</br>
         **test1 : accuracy was 0.9807692307692307</br>
         **test2 : accuracy was 0.9663461538461539🤷‍♀️</p>
